===> Get Stash
------------------------------------------
You have some changes that your not quit ready to commit and maybe you need to switch branches or even just you want to revert back temporarily to where it was that you started and you dont know what to do with your changes where you can do a stash on those changes and it will save them in a temporary place to where you can go and do what it is that you need to do and then come back to those changes later on. So best way is just to show you an example here so i've got a very simple dot pi file over here its just an add subtract, multiple and divide functions and right now they dont have any return values so.
